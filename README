Consider n point masses m1, ... ,mn in three-dimensional (physical) space. Suppose that the force of attraction experienced between each pair of particles is Newtonian. Then, if the initial positions in space and initial velocities are specified for every particle at some present instant t0, determine the position of each particle at every future (or past) moment of time.
